now check the value and forward elsewhere
button destinations are self-explanatory
btw, they're set in mainMenu.start()

anyway, this has to be a loop, otherwise the player won't be able to go back and forth between menus

redrawing of the background shouldn't be here, as each module cleans up after itself,
because that's what their parents taught them! 
(well, mostly)
